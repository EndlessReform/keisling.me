# Hammertime 10: Murphyjitsu

# Abstract (2.5 min)
Parameter: Find a project that doesn’t seem to be happening and, over the next week, pull out all the stops to make it happen: reminders, doubling time, etc. etc. Anticipate how the project might fail and try to work through failure modes.

# Possible projects (5 min)
Possible projects I’ve been considering:
* Personal website. Why is this valuable? 1) Practice coding 2) Promotion for employers 3) Opportunity to boost morale by showing off 4) Provides target for future writing / design projects to build off (e.g. an online presence for what I learned in CS 162 / 154).
* Project to slow down time. Why is this valuable?
	1. Weeks and months pass where I really have no idea what I did
	2. I end up wasting enormous amounts of time and need to stop that
	3. I’m essentially in Gap Year 2.0 with a few more online classes: need to make use of this time to hard reset
* Actually consistently reviewing code on a regular basis. Why is this valuable?
	1. I need to read more code
	2. I need to get better for interviews
	3. I need to do better

# Which project do I select? (2.5 min)
Personal website offers medium-term serotonin, but provides object-level skills in web dev which I don’t necessarily need or want. I estimate 20-40 hours of work, which could get done in two or so weeks.

Consistently reviewing code is an important goal and needs to get done soon - but it’s such a Herculean project that it seems beyond the scope of this project. Can we narrow this down somehow?

Slowing down time is a good goal - but honestly it’s the sort of thing I’m probably going to do, Jitsu or no Jitsu, and it would be a total cop-out.

Conclusion: Personal website as part of code review meta goal

# Let’s think about the problem (5 min)
What do we actually want to accomplish? No implementation!

* A personal knowledge base: Somewhere where I can dump my CMSC / rationality / iPadOS review notes that isn’t just a random folder on my computer, but which I’ll actually want to look at. 
	* Discoverability: I want to actually look at my notes again rather than have them live in some useless silo like my current ones
	* Beauty: It needs to be fun to continue researching
	* Possible view for others
	* Possible review during exams: I need to be able to comprehend this information quickly
	* What kind of information? E.g. Djikstra’s Algorithm: working code, links to sources, human-readable explanation, possibly visualization
* A CV: Something for employers to look at and think “This is Jacob Keisling”
	* Danger of putting political views in a blog with my name on it. Consider forking code and putting under some unenumerable subdomain
	* Could backfire
* A testing ground for web technologies (e.g. anime.js) and web design
* A blog: Somewhere for my thoughts to go. Not so that others can read, but so that the personal effort of making things legible for others forces me to distill my thoughts
* Somewhere to have fun

# What are potential pitfalls with the project? (10 min)
How have similar such problems failed in the past?
* No accountability: nobody knows about it -> no incentive to continue
* Scope is too big: All effort felt like throwing effort down a black hole; the project seemed impossible because it was too big
* Similarly, no tangible subgoals / reward: “Make website” is not a primitive action
* No time boxing: Essentially infinite time was spent on the NRF website in the beginning because the parameters were too ambitious and the constraints were sort of varied
* Everything takes a long time: Expectations for the NRF website were so grueling and unrealistic that everything felt like an enormous effort; I’ve built subconscious feelings of dread when tackling such a project
* Latent shame: I’ve failed so often that I really doubt any project will succeed, and I don’t think that anything I do could measure up
* No time: this project was simply not a priority when compared to other similar projects competing for attention. (E.g. coursework, Japanese, exercise, romance, conversation)

Looking forward to this project, how do I imagine it failing?
* The goal is so lofty that it’s unrealistic and I just forget about it, like SRS or Leetcode
* I don’t know “when” to do it and so just forget about it: no anchors in the daily schedule. Note: this is also the problem with WaniKani, which is currently hitting an extremely rough patch. At this point, just time box the damn thing.
* I hit a wall and just give up
	* The project feels unrewarding
	* I forget why I’m doing it
	* No short term successes or gratification! Instant gratification is actually quite important; if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this quarter, it’s that being miserable actually is quite expensive and limited self-reward actually helps quite a bit
* Real life gets in the way
	* How do I decide to prioritize this or some other project (e.g. hammertime itself, exercise, gaming, socializing?)
	* I need to timebox this commitment, or it will destroy me. if it’s “1 hour”, it’s obviously unrealistic

# How can I solve these problems? (5 min)
Object level: don’t actually talk about the object level!
* How do I make this project realistic?
	* I realize this isn’t top priority, and timebox the problem to: 1 hour a day, every day I’m not biking
	* I start with a minimum viable product and focus on making things better later: don’t expect perfection off the bat and favor rapid iteration over perfect solutions. Technical debt is perfectly acceptable (e.g. picking the wrong platform / wrong font / wrong scheme because of timeboxing)
	* I break the project up into subgoals - starting by 時間 instead of by how long it takes
* How do I make this project gratifying?
	* Microgoals: Have very clear, granular phases with commitments you can actually meet
	* Get results early! If you’re doing research, take time to write it up. Put the website online first. Get MVP out first.
* How do I make this project mandatory?
	* Repurpose Streaks timer

# How will I actually get this done? (5 min)
Series of goals for 10 hours: Minimumest viable product! Get a blog because that’s the easiest thing to do. Rip off that one guy’s personal website wholesale.

* 2 hours for UI design and prototyping
* 6 hours for coding everything in Gatsby / React
* 2 hours for hosting with Netlify

Whatever you get done in that time box is what’s going up. We can make other goals after this is done.

When will it get done? Starting...tomorrow, 2 hours per day on weekends and 1 hour on weekdays without biking. What time of day? On weekends, from 1600h to 1800h, on weekdays from 1715h to 1815h on days that aren’t biking days. How will it get done? Timers. Lots and lots of timers.
